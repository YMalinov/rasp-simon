Rasp-Simon
==========

Implementation of the massively popular "Simon" memory game, made for the Raspberry Pi, utilizing the GPIO pins for input (using switches) and output (using LEDs).

NOTE: The maximum number of lives is defined by the LED/switch pairs you have at your disposal. Each time you lose a life, the number of LEDs which light up, when you make a mistake, will decrease.

Intended for Python 2.7.
